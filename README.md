# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
Developed Titanic Survival Prediction: Employed machine learning models to predict passenger survival based on key features, improving accuracy in historical survival outcomes.

## Key Techniques
- **Data Splitting**:
  - Employed `KFold` and `StratifiedKFold` for data splitting during model training to ensure robust evaluation.
- **Modeling**:
  - Utilized `ExtraTreesClassifier` to analyze feature importance and improve prediction accuracy.
- **Data Encoding**:
  - Applied `LabelEncoder` for encoding categorical data, facilitating model training.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Utilized `classification_report` for detailed classification metrics analysis after model testing.
